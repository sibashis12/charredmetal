This website uses javascript, css and html to provide an engaging and fun quiz app experience. main.js contains code written in a modular fashion, with many helper functions, and as such no function is too lengthy. Since this is my first proper website, I have gone a bit heavy into the color-changing transitions. utils.css contains utility styles that I will use in the future too. main.css contains the styles unique to this project.
